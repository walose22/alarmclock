# Alarm Clock

## Project Description
This is a simple Alarm Clock application built using vanilla JavaScript. The application allows users to view the current time, set multiple alarms, and receive alerts when the alarms go off. The project includes features like adding and deleting alarms, and it is styled using Bootstrap.

## Features
- **Clock Face**: Displays the current time with updating seconds, minutes, and hours.
- **Set Alarm**: Allows users to set alarms by providing hour, minute, second, and AM/PM inputs.
- **Alarms List**: Displays a list of all set alarms with the option to delete each alarm.
- **Alerts**: Uses JavaScript's alert function to notify the user when an alarm goes off.

## How to Use
1. **View Current Time**: The clock face will automatically display the current time.
2. **Set Alarm**:
    - Enter the desired alarm time in the input boxes (hour, minute, second, AM/PM).
    - Click the "Set Alarm" button to add the alarm to the list.
3. **Delete Alarm**: Click the delete button next to any set alarm in the list to remove it.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the clock and alarm functionality.

## Code Explanation
- **Clock Functionality**: The `updateClock` function continuously updates the clock face to show the current time.
- **Set Alarm**: The `setAlarm` function adds a new alarm to the alarms list and sets a timeout to trigger the alert.
- **Delete Alarm**: The `deleteAlarm` function removes an alarm from the list without triggering an alert.
